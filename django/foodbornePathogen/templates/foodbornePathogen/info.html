				<h2 class="welcome-title animated fadeInLeft">Pipeline Information</h2>
				<p class="animated fadeInRight">This foodborne pathogen analysis pipeline performs genomics analysis on <i style="font-style: italic;">C.jejuni</i> isolates. The full pipeline contains these four steps: genome analysis, gene prediction, functional annotation, and comparative genomics. The pipeline can be run in full, as individual steps, or as any consecutive combination of steps.</p>
				<h2 class="welcome-title animated fadeInLeft">Instructions</h2>
				<p class="animated fadeInRight">
					1. Access the pipeline steps you would like to run using the Run Pipeline button.
					<br></br>
					2. Enter your email and upload required files.
					Each isolate you wish to process must be uploaded as an individual .zip. You may upload multiple isolates.
					Each .zip must contain all dependencies required for that pipeline segment shown in the dot matrix graph shown below.
					File extensions must match the table exactly.
					Parenthesized inputs are optional depending on whether the user has requested the corresponding outputs shown in the data dependecy chart below.
					All files must have the same basename as the zip file containing them, with the exception of FASTQ files.
					Paired-end read FASTQ files must be individually gunzipped as {isolateBasename}_1.fq.gz & {isolateBasename}_2.fq.gz, zipped into {isolateBasename}.zip which is zipped inside the isolate .zip.
					If only FASTQ files are required, the redundant nested .zip folder should be eliminated.
					<br></br>

					<br></br>
					Empty dummy files to exemplify that data upload for various jobs:
						<a href="static/dummy/GA/isolateName.zip">Full Pipeline</a>
						<a href="static/dummy/GP/isolateName.zip">Gene Prediction</a>
						<a href="static/dummy/FA/isolateName.zip">Functional Annotation</a>
						<a href="static/dummy/CG/isolateName.zip">Comparative Genomics</a>

					<br></br>
					3. Select pipeline and analysis options.
					<br></br>
					4. Click submit. Depending on the size of your upload, it may take a few minutes before you are redirected to a submission confirmation page. Do NOT navigate away from this page until the redirect is complete.
					A results page will be sent to the email provided with links to download analysis results.
					<br></br>
					For more information on options, file types, and analysis methods, please refer to our <a href="https://github.gatech.edu/comgenomics2021/Team1-WebServer">GitHub</a> and <a href="https://compgenomics2021.biosci.gatech.edu/Team_I_Webserver">Wiki</a> pages. A diagram of the pipeline is shown below.
